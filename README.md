# Product Review & Rating System on Blockchain

A decentralized application (dApp) on Ethereum that enables **transparent, immutable, and trustable product reviews and ratings**. Using smart contracts, it guarantees that product feedback cannot be tampered with, fostering fair evaluations.

##  Features

### Role-Based Access Control
- **Admin**: Add or delete products.  
- **User**: Browse products, post reviews, and rate products.

### Product Management
- Add products with name, description, price (in Wei), and image (base64).  
- Admin only controls product deletion.

### Decentralized Reviews & Ratings
- Users can leave comments and rate products on a 1â€“5 scale.  
- Ratings and reviews are permanently stored on the Ethereum blockchain.

### Real-Time Product Info
- Products show ID, name, description, price, image, creator, and average rating.  
- Ratings and comments fetched live from blockchain.

### MetaMask Authentication
- Connect via MetaMask wallet for login/registration.  
- Roles assigned via UI; no centralized database needed.
